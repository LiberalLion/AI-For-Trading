- 1. Data is listed below for one ticker symbol. Create a table in a database (Postgres or MySQL). Use Python to insert data into the database.

2. Use Python to analyze data and create an investing/trading strategy of your choice. If you are not aware of any strategy: use simple moving average crossover


Submit the result of how your strategy is performing.



Test Case:

Write a unit testing module with the test cases below:

Check if input data is valid ( Open High Low Close need to be decimals), volume needs to be integer, instrument needs to be String, datetime needs to be datetime

- To create a table in a database, first, we need to install and set up the database. For this example, we will be using PostgresSQL.
### Setting up PostgresSQL
1. Download and install PostgresSQL on your system.
2. Once installed, open pgAdmin (a tool to manage PostgreSQL databases)
3. Create a new database by right-clicking on "Databases" in the left panel and selecting "New Database".
4. Give your database a name and click "Save".
5. You will now see your new database in the left panel. Right-click on it and select "Query Tool".
6. In the query tool, enter the following command to create a new table:

```sql

CREATE TABLE stock_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    instrument VARCHAR(10),
    date DATE,
    open DECIMAL,
    high DECIMAL,
    low DECIMAL,
    close DECIMAL,
    volume INTEGER
);
```



This will create a new table named "stock_data" with columns for id, instrument, date, open, high, low, close, and volume.
### Inserting Data

We can insert data into the table using Python and the psycopg2 library. First, we need to install psycopg2 using pip:

```

pip install psycopg2
```



Once installed, we can use the following code to insert data into the table:

```python

import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="my_database",
    user="my_username",
    password="my_password"
)

# Load the data from Google Sheets
url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-rIkEb94tZ69FvsjXnfkVETYu6rftF-8/export?format=csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Insert each row of data into the table
cur = conn.cursor()
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    cur.execute(
        "INSERT INTO stock_data (instrument, date, open, high, low, close, volume) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)",
        (row['Instrument'], row['Date'], row['Open'], row['High'], row['Low'], row['Close'], row['Volume'])
    )
conn.commit()

# Close the database connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```



This code connects to the database, loads the data from the Google Sheets link, and inserts each row of data into the table.
### Analyzing Data and Creating a Trading Strategy

For this example, we will use a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy involves calculating the 50-day and 200-day moving averages of the closing price, and buying when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, and selling when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average.

We can use Python and the Pandas library to implement this strategy:

```python

import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="my_database",
    user="my_username",
    password="my_password"
)
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM stock_data ORDER BY date", conn)

# Calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages
df['ma50'] = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['ma200'] = df['close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a new column for the position (1 for long, 0 for short)
df['position'] = 0
df.loc[df['
```

- # Trading Strategy Project

This project involves building a simple trading strategy using Python and a PostgreSQL database. The strategy used in this project is the simple moving average crossover strategy.
## Setup
### PostgreSQL Setup

To set up PostgreSQL, follow these steps: 
1. Download and install PostgreSQL on your system. 
2. Open pgAdmin (a tool to manage PostgreSQL databases). 
3. Create a new database by right-clicking on "Databases" in the left panel and selecting "New Database". 
4. Give your database a name and click "Save". 
5. Right-click on your new database and select "Query Tool". 
6. In the query tool, enter the following command to create a new table:

```sql

CREATE TABLE stock_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    instrument VARCHAR(10),
    date DATE,
    open DECIMAL,
    high DECIMAL,
    low DECIMAL,
    close DECIMAL,
    volume INTEGER
);
```
### Python Setup

To set up Python, follow these steps:
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher on your system. 
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
## Usage
### Inserting Data

To insert data into the database, run the following command:

```

python insert_data.py
```



This will load the data from the Google Sheets link and insert it into the `stock_data` table in the PostgreSQL database.
### Running the Trading Strategy

To run the trading strategy, run the following command:

```

python trading_strategy.py
```



This will load the data from the `stock_data` table, calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and create a new column for the position (1 for long, 0 for short) based on the crossover of the moving averages.
### Running the Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, run the following command:

```

python -m unittest discover
```



This will run all of the unit tests in the `tests` directory.
## Strategy Performance

The performance of the simple moving average crossover strategy can be analyzed by examining the results of the `trades.csv` file that is generated by the `trading_strategy.py` script. This file contains a list of trades made by the strategy, including the entry date, entry price, exit date, exit price, and profit/loss.

By analyzing the trades, we can determine the overall profitability of the strategy. It is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and that trading strategies should be thoroughly tested and backtested before being used in a live trading environment.
